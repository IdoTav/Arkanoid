# Arkanoid
# About
An Arkanoid game that was a part of an OOP course that I had during the first year of my bachelor degree. This project was made in Java language, following OOP principles:

* Polymorphism and inheritance.
* Design patterns in OOP - Observer, Builder, etc.
* Generic collections and data structures - linked lists and arraylists.
* Working with GUI.
